### Task 1: Proof that XORing an operand with itself changes the operand to 0

```text
Start
  │
  ▼
Initialize register
  │
  ▼
XOR eax, eax
  │
  ▼
Result: eax = 0
  │
  ▼
Proof complete
```
---

### Implement TEST Instruction

```text
Start
  │
  ▼
Set eax ← 8
  │
  ▼
TEST eax, 1 (check least significant bit)
  │
  ▼
Is Zero Flag (ZF) set?
  ├─ Yes ─► Jump to even block (value is even)
  │
  └─ No ─► Continue to odd block (value is odd)

Then:
  ▼
Write 'y' if even, 'n' if odd
  ▼
Done
```

## Proof that XORing an operand with itself changes the operand to 0:

```assembly
section .text
    global _start

_start:
    mov eax, 10
    xor eax, eax       ; eax = 0 after this

    mov eax, 1
    int 0x80
```

##  Create a case where you can implement a TEST instruction:
```assembly
section .text
    global _start

_start:
    mov eax, 8
    test eax, 1        ; check if even (LSB = 0)
    jz evnn            ; jump if even (zero flag is set)

    mov eax, 'n'       ; if odd, store 'n'
    mov [result], eax
    mov eax, 1
    int 0x80

evnn:
    mov eax, 'y'       ; if even, store 'y'
    mov [result], eax
    mov eax, 1
    int 0x80

section .bss
    result resb 1
```
## Debugging
```assembly
layout asm
layout regs
watch (int) result
break _start
run
stepi
```
## Challenge
### task1:
I didn’t really get what XOR does at first, but then I tried doing `xor eax, eax` and it just made it zero. That was kinda cool. So the challenge was just realizing that it clears stuff without needing to move zero in.
### task2:
I used `test` to see if a number was even or odd but wasn’t sure how it worked. Turns out it doesn’t change the number, just sets a flag.
