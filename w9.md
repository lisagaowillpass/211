### Task 1 Flowchart – Generate Even Numbers

```text
Start
  │
  ▼
Set eax = 0
  │
  ▼
Add 2 to eax
  │
  ▼
Repeat 10 times
(2, 4, 6, ..., 20)
  │
  ▼
Exit program
```

### Task 2: Find Largest of 5 Numbers

```text
Start
  │
  ▼
Set eax = var1
  │
  ▼
Compare eax with var2
  │   └─ if var2 > eax → eax = var2
  ▼
Compare eax with var3
  │   └─ if var3 > eax → eax = var3
  ▼
Compare eax with var4
  │   └─ if var4 > eax → eax = var4
  ▼
Compare eax with var5
  │   └─ if var5 > eax → eax = var5
  ▼
Store eax in [largest]
  ▼
Exit program
```
## Generate even numbers up to 20
```assembly
section .text
    global _start

_start:
    mov eax, 0          ; start at 0

    add eax, 2          ; 2
    add eax, 2          ; 4
    add eax, 2          ; 6
    add eax, 2          ; 8
    add eax, 2          ; 10
    add eax, 2          ; 12
    add eax, 2          ; 14
    add eax, 2          ; 16
    add eax, 2          ; 18
    add eax, 2          ; 20

    mov eax, 1
    int 0x80
```
## Find the largest of five numbers
```assembly
section .text
    global _start

_start:
    mov eax, [var1]
    cmp eax, [var2]
    jg skip1
    mov eax, [var2]
skip1:
    cmp eax, [var3]
    jg skip2
    mov eax, [var3]
skip2:
    cmp eax, [var4]
    jg skip3
    mov eax, [var4]
skip3:
    cmp eax, [var5]
    jg skip4
    mov eax, [var5]
skip4:
    mov [largest], eax

    mov eax, 1
    int 0x80

section .data
    var1 dd 1
    var2 dd 2
    var3 dd 3
    var4 dd 4
    var5 dd 5

section .bss
    largest resb 1
```
## debug
```assembly

## challenges
```text
Task1:
Probabaly would be better if I do a loop instead of writing it out bunch of times, but the logic is hard to comeby, I'll do better next time.

Task2:
This one was super repetitive. I wasn’t sure if I was supposed to use loops but I just did the same compare and jump like five times. Also I forgot which one means “greater than” like three times so I had to keep changing jg and mov around.
```
